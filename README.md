# Kotlin Raytracer

A basic raytracer in Kotlin.

## Getting Started

Build the project:

```
./gradlew build
```

Run to produce a render of a basic scene:

```
./gradlew run
```

The output is an image in PPM format, a simple but inefficient image format. It can be viewed with
many image viewers including Mac Preview.

The output file is located at: `app/renders/image.ppm`
